# Implementation Metadata
- Project Files: 
  - requirements.txt - Core dependencies without version specifications
  - .env - Environment configuration for AI service
  - app/__init__.py - Package initialization
  - app/models.py - Pydantic models for API data structures
  - app/main.py - FastAPI application entry point
  - app/services/__init__.py - Services package initialization
  - app/services/ai_service.py - Logic for AI model communication
  - app/services/translation_tools.py - Data format translation functions
  - app/services/validation_service.py - FHIR resource validation
  - README.md - Project documentation

- Key decisions:
  - Used FastAPI for high performance and automatic documentation
  - Implemented async HTTP client for AI service communication
  - Structured code in modular services for maintainability
  - Used Pydantic for request/response validation
  - Implemented error handling for AI service and translation failures

- Changes: 2025-06-11T16:53:30.076+08:00 Created initial implementation of the Healthcare Interoperability System based on the blueprint

- Future Possible Plans:
  - Add more translation tools (CDA to FHIR, etc.)
  - Implement routing logic to send data to target systems
  - Add authentication and authorization
  - Add logging and monitoring
  - Implement caching for frequently used translations
